# ML_cancer-patient-survival

This project predicts cancer patient outcomes (Alive or Dead) using Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 
It includes key processes like data preprocessing, handling missing values, class balancing with SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and evaluation of model performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, handling missing values, and encoding.
- **Class Balancing**: Applied SMOTE to address data imbalance.
- **Model Training**: Implemented multiple models to compare performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized models with GridSearchCV.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

This project showcases proficiency in machine learning and its practical application in data analytics.
